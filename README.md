# Impetus
Impetus incentivizes students to go to their classes daily. The students will be rewarded points to attend their classes, and rewards can be used to get gift cards from local merchants or big online brands.It will increase overall attendance in class, and interaction among students, and result in higher overall GPA, and graduation.

Problem  - 


The sudden fall in interactions between students and their institutes after the pandemic has resulted in uncertainty in grades, a fall in attendance, reduced collaboration among the students, and some extreme cases, delay in graduation.

Uses Cases -


1) Helping colleges to increase their attendance and engagement on campus.
2) Impetus will provide incentives to students that they can use for their daily purchases. It will ultimately help them to have a better academic standing, and help them to better use university resources for their development.
3) Impetus will help partnered colleges to have a higher GPA, and higher attendance percentage.
4) Local corporate partners will have an increase in revenue and exposure among the students.
